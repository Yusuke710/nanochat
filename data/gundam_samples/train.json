    "answer": "THE HISTORY of social media\n\n[Icons shown: Friendster, Wordpress, Tumblr, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram]\n\nSocial media channels seem to be everywhere and with 135 minutes of our time spent on social media platforms every day, it's crazy to think that it's only been 20 years since the first social media site was made. Without any further ado, here we have the history of social media!\n\nTHE BEGINNING - 1844\nSamuel Morse made the first step towards some resemblance of social media when he sent a telegram from Washington D.C. to Baltimore. Morse's first message read \"What Hath God Wrought?\"\n\nMILITARY'S FIRST SOCIAL MEDIA ATTEMPT - 1969\nARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) wanted to connect Universities on a proto-internet. It worked great...if you worked in the military. Unfortunately, the letters 'U' weren't the complete 'LOGIN' that they had planned to send over.\n\nSTART OF SOCIAL SITES - 1997\nFrom 1997 to 2001, Six Degrees had a peak of about 1 million members who were able to create profiles and 'friend' each other.\n\nCREATIVITY AND STATUS BLOGS - 1999\nLiveJournal was a platform where users could blog as a form of keeping friends updated with their lives. A format later used by Facebook for their 'status'.\n\nA CHALLENGER EMERGES - 2002\nFriendster, one of the first social media sites, is created and launched by Peter Chin, Jonathan Abrams, and Dave Lee. Within the first three months, Friendster had three million users and turned down a $30 million buyout from Google, widely considered one of the biggest blunders of Silicon Valley.\n\nLINK UP WITH BUSINESSES - 2003\nLinkedIn gives users a place to post their resume and private message people with a paid feature. LinkedIn is still a popular way for businesses to scout for new employees and for users to search for jobs. By 2007, the social network for jobs would reach 1 million. 13 years later they would break 500 million users.\n\nGMAIL RECEIVED - 2004\nGoogle enters the communications space, Gmail. In the UK Gmail was branded as Google Mail due to naming disputes. This lasted until 2009 when they changed the branding back after the dispute was over.\n\nFACEBOOK BEGINS - 2004\nIn February 2004, Facebook was launched by Mark Zuckerberg, along with his Harvard roommates. The site was initially limited to Harvard students then was expanded to other universities and over years, this membership would be worldwide and number of users grew to around 2.2 billion in 14 years.\n\nBIRTH OF YOUTUBE - 2005\nYouTube, a platform on which users can upload and share videos, was made public in February 2005. The first video to hit 1m million views also came within this year thanks to a Nike advert featuring Ronaldinho.\n\nFacebook is now made available in the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand on October 1st.\n\nMYSPACE IS BOOMING - 2006\nMyspace became the most popular social network in the US during 2006! That's just 3 years after it was founded.\n\nTwitter is launched publically on July 15th.\n\n750 TWEETS PER SECOND! - 2010\n65 million tweets a day are being sent out on Twitter, that's around 750 tweets every second.\n\nLAUNCH OF SNAPCHAT - 2013\nSnapchat, an image messaging app, is launched in September after being tested as 'Picaboo' in July 2011. One of the founding members is pushed out before Snapchat is released.\n\nSHORT VIDEOS, MEGA VIEWS - 2013\nVine, a video hosting service specializing in short videos, goes public in June. Twitter acquires Vine for $30 million in the October of that year.\n\nUK'S INSTA ADS - 2014\nInstagram brings sponsored Ads to target the UK in September following their inclusion on the app in America.\n\nLIFE OF A STARMAN - 2015\nNASA's #YearInSpace hashtag, giving Twitter followers updates on Scott Kelly an astronaut who lived in space for a year!\n\nVR AND FAKE NEWS - 2018\nVirtual Reality, live videos, and 360-degree videos replace all video content on social media as the 'new' form of social media. There was a crackdown on fake news throughout social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAfter all of this, we now have a beautiful array of social media channels to pick and choose from. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and more. We wonder what next advancement social media creators will think up, what do you think will happen in the future world of social media?\n\nwww.redgiraffe.uk",
